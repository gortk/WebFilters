# NSFW WebFilters
A repository with webfilters mostly for ublacklist.
This is not an anti-nsfw content list. It is there to filter crap sites and make your life easier while
browsing for content.

To start, select the "NSFW" folder, read the readme file inside it and import the filter. 
That's all.

WARNING: this filter will remove TONS of results.
