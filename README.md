# NSFW Search Filters
A repository with search filters for ublacklist.
This is not an anti-nsfw content list. It is there to filter crap sites and make your life easier while
browsing for content.

To start, select the "NSFW" folder, read the readme file inside it and import the filter. 
That's all.

WARNING: this filter will remove TONS of results.


## Key notes:
Internet is changing constantly. There still will be "bad" sites in the results, but hopefully the trash will
be way less. 

- The list prioritizes "real human" content.
- Some crappy amateur xxx drawings sites removed.
- Furry focused sites are actively blocked.
- Trans-gay focused sites are actively blocked.
- Mainstream paid sites are actively blocked.
- Mainstream streaming "tube" sites are actively blocked (see the readme on why).
- Some java locked content sites are blocked (difficult to download from them).
- Bad quality "real human" content sites are actively blocked.
